      <h1>Cyber Security Threats to Hospitals Industry</h1>
      <p>
        The hospital industry has
        lagged other industries in protecting patient data and hospital infrastructure from cybersecurity threats.
        Therefore, they must invest more capital and effort to
        protect their systems. This is easier said than done because hospitals are highly regulated and complex
        organizations with high end point complexity in terms of technology.
      </p>
      <p>The threat trends in the hospital industry are as below -
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phishing - </strong>The most common cybersecurity threat in healthcare is phishing.
          Phishing is the act of inserting harmful links into a seemingly innocent email. Email phishing is the most
          typical kind of phishing in the hospitals industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware Attacks - </strong>Malware is introduced into a network during a ransomware assault to
          infect and encrypt sensitive data until a ransom is paid. In 2020, more than one in three healthcare
          businesses on a global scale were attacked with ransomware.
          The reason for its prevalence is because hackers are aware of how important it is for the healthcare industry
          to keep operational disruptions to a minimum. Healthcare victims of ransomware attacks become terrified of the
          legal repercussions that may follow the theft of patient data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches - </strong>Comparatively speaking, the healthcare sector has a disproportionately high
          number of data breaches. In the healthcare industry, there were 1.76 data breaches on average every day in
          2020.
          HIPAA lays forth stringent guidelines for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information like health
          data, but many healthcare organizations have trouble putting its security rules into practice.</li>
        <li><strong>DDOS attacks - </strong>A distributed denial-of-service attack involves flooding a targeted server
          with bogus connection requests in an effort to take it offline. This coordinated attack uses a large number of
          endpoints and IOT devices that have been forced recruited into a botnet through malware infection.</li>
