      <h1>Current Landscape
      </h1>
      <p>The healthcare industry is a top target for malicious threat actors due to the value of sensitive information
        such as Personally Identifiable Information, an increase of IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), insufficient
        cybersecurity protection, legacy systems, and insufficient cybersecurity staffing training.
        Outside the local landscape, global threats from the Nation States are also present.
      <blockquote>“Nation-state threats to
        healthcare include attacks in 2014, 2018, and 2020 by Chinese-state sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (ADP)
        groups.” </blockquote>Russian Nation State threat ADP 29 ‘CozyBear’ have remained prevalent through the COVID-19
      pandemic,
      leveraging phishing, exploits, and custom malware for information theft targeted at healthcare organizations.
      Threat actors may be local, such as an employee accessing restricted or protected data, or global, such as
      entire nation states attempting to gain access to secured systems.

      <h1>How common are security breaches?
      </h1>
      <p>
      <blockquote>“Between 2009 and 2021, 4,419 healthcare data breaches of 500 or more records have been reported…
        [leading] to the loss, theft, exposure, or impermissible disclosure of 314,063,186 healthcare records…more than
        94.63% of the 2021 population of the United States.”</blockquote>
      Breaches are increasingly common, and attacks by malicious threat actors are expected – it is not a
      matter of ‘if an attack occurs’ but ‘when’. To quote the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber
      Command– Gen. Keith B. Alexander - <blockquote></blockquote>“Either you know you’ve been hacked or you’ve been
      hacked and you don’t know
      you’ve been hacked.”</blockquote>

    <section>
      <h1>How does changing strategies move us into intelligence?
      </h1>
      <p>Cybersecurity is of paramount importance to an organization's operational success. Operations must be
        structured in a way to maximize benefits and reduce risk. IT Cybersecurity must be aligned with Operations to
        minimize the substantial risks posed by malicious actors. It is not a matter of “if” but a matter of “when” a
        breach happens, and organizational strategy must consider this to move into intelligent operations. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>What are the costs associated with breaches?
      </h1>
      <p>
      <blockquote>“The 2021 cost of healthcare data breaches [have] soared to an average of $9.3 million per occurrence…
        a 29.5
        percent increase over 2020’s average of $7.13 million.” </blockquote>

      This 9.3 million per occurrence includes
      lost business
      costs such as business downtime, loss of customers, brand damage, and diminished goodwill. There may be
      additional costs if the breaches were in violation of HIPPA compliance. Employees and C-Suite Level executives
      may also have their position terminated to salvage the company's reputation.

      <h1>How can intelligence-based security reduce the average cost of a data breach for the organization?
      </h1>
      <p>Intelligence-based security can use AI to quickly determine attacks on the networks performing automated
        responses to attacks such as shutting down systems, revoking user credentials, and notifying of any digital
        resources access. If an attack is automatically prevented and responded to then the potential cost savings is
        $9.3 million per occurrence.
      <blockquote>“Security AI and Automation Controls reduce data breach costs by 70%”2 and can detect breaches faster
        at 249 days instead of the average of 323 days. </blockquote>
