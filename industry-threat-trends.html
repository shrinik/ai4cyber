      Cybersecurity incidents are a growing threat to the health care industry
      in general and hospitals in particular. The health care industry has
      lagged behind other industries in protecting its main stakeholder (ie,
      patients), and now hospitals must invest considerable capital and effort
      in protecting their systems. However, this is easier said than done
      because hospitals are extraordinarily technology-saturated, complex
      organizations with high end point complexity, internal politics, and
      regulatory pressures.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enhance cybersecurity capabilities at hospitals, the main focus of
      chief information officers and chief information security officers
      should be on reducing end point complexity and improving internal
      stakeholder alignment. These strategies can solve cybersecurity problems
      more effectively than blindly pursuing more resources. On a macro level,
      the cyber vulnerability of a country’s hospital infrastructure is
      affected by the vulnerabilities of all individual hospitals. In this
      large system, reducing variation in resource availability makes the
      whole system less vulnerable—a few hospitals with low resources for
      cybersecurity threaten the entire infrastructure of health care. In
      other words, hospitals need to move forward together to make the
      industry less attractive to cybercriminals. Moreover, although
      compliance is essential, it does not equal security. Hospitals should
      set their target level of cybersecurity beyond the requirements of
      current regulations and policies. As of today, policies mostly address
      data privacy, not data security. Thus, policy makers need to introduce
      policies that not only raise the target level of cybersecurity
      capabilities but also reduce the variability in resource availability
      across the entire health care system.
