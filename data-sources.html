            <li>Phishing was identified as one of the most common threats faced by the hospital industry.</li>
            <li>Successful phishing attemps can lead to data breaches and ransomware which can put hospital data,
              patient
              data and patient medical records at risk.</li>
            <li>
              PhishTank allows users to submit suspected phishes and track the status of their
              submissions. Multiple users must submit a phish in order for it to be added to the database.
            </li>
            <li>PhishTank continuously updated with new threats</li>
            <li>PhishTank monitors all industries, not just healthcare thus providing a comprehensive view of potential
              phishing attacks.

            <li>The healthcare sector has a disproportionately high number of data breaches and hence data breaches was
              identified as a major threat trend for the hospital industry</li>
            <li>Nowadays, a typical hospital utilizes dozens of IoT devices, including wearables, guided imagery,
              monitoring sensors, implantable, ingestible, etc. </li>
            <li>Large-scale use of IoT in healthcare involves the processing and transfer of patients personal
              information
              and raises issues around privacy and security since many medical IoT devices lack robust security.</li>
            <li>
              Shodan will help to search and identify all medical IoT devices for the organization for further
              assessment.
            </li>
            <li>Shodan will be used to search and collect data related to IoT medical devices, Hospital management
              systems, or medical devices manufacturer that are connected to the internet directly.

            <li>DICOM is a protocol used in medical imaging machines. The search query will search for the keyword
              "DICOM
              Server Response" for port 104</li>
            <li>The data is downloaded using the Shodan API and converted to a suitable format for analysis file </li>

            <li>The hospital industry's critical assets include IT infrastructure and Information Systems.</li>
            <li>These assets are vulnerable to malware such as ransomware which was identified as one of the top threats
              faced by the hospital industry</li>
            <li>CVEs that are not addressed can be exploited by adversaries to introduce malware like ransomware or for
              data breaches.</li>
            <li>
              CVEs , is the abbreviation for a list of openly reported computer security issues. A security issue with a
              CVE
              ID number is what is meant when someone mentions a CVE.Almost invariably, vendors' and researchers'
              security
              warnings list at least one CVE ID.
            </li>
            <li>CVEs aid IT specialists in the hospitals in organizing their efforts to prioritize and fix these flaws
              to
              strengthen the security of computer systems across the hospitals network.
            </li>
            <li>Therefore it is important for the hospital industry to keep track of CVEs to understand and protect the
              IT
              infrastructure and Information systems from ransomware and data breaches.</li>
