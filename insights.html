          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>We found that scanning Shodan for medical devices by manufacturers such as Omron yields thousands of
              devices that were accessible on the public internet.
            </li>
            <li>As hospitals focus on patient care through rapid developing technology, cybersecurity is not taken in
              consideration.</li>
            <li>Due to the largely unmanaged or undermanaged state of many IoMT device assets on the hospital premise,
              it is implied that the standard approach for cyber security will be insufficient for hospital networks.
            </li>
            <li>Although hospital networks are generally open for communication, it is vital to at least take steps to
              partially segment networks and use AI to scan for unauthorized access. </li>
          </ul>

        <h1>IoMT</h1>
        <section>
          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>We found that the top vulnerabilities for a hack often came from IoMT devices. These devices are often
              publicly accessible and can be found during the internet search. Hospitals are in the business of saving
              lives, as such, the IoMT devices are developed at a rapid pace without Cybersecurity being maintained.
            </li>
            <li>In one single search of a manufacturer such as Omron, we found that NVD for CPE appeared 42 times in the
              dataset. </li>
            <li>Simply, in order to save lives, technology must adapt quickly, devices are going to innately be
              unsecured regardless of vendor. Faulty programming, bugs in software and manufacturer backdoors lead to
              high risk devices.
            </li>
            <li>The implication is that any one of the thousands of IoMT devices within a hospital can be a gateway to a
              hackerâ€™s entry into the network. Once in the network, a hacker can easily shut down life saving medical
              tools in demand for ransom and data loss may occur. The net result, people will die.</li>
            <li>Wherever possible, these IoMT devices should be placed behind a strict Firewall or NAT and accessed with
              up-to-date protocols such as WPA3 and current standards of encryption to reduce the attack surface.
              Devices must maintain a ridged update schedule to immediately patch any vulnerabilities discovered by the
              manufacturer.

        <h1>External Servers and Phishing</h1>
        <section>
          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>We found that the top type of attack in the hospital industry was Phishing. Healthcare employees receive
              an average of 14 to 59 malicious emails per year.
            </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, due to antiquated email protocols that are still used today, blocking phishing emails is
              no easy task; a hacker simply changes emails or spoofs their email address.
            </li>
            <li>While we expect demand for external servers such as websites and general internet access, the hospital
              industry can reduce their attack surface by providing better centralized cybersecurity services that
              proactively monitor emails through the use of AI and ML and clustering techniques to determine if a
              website is phishing or not.
            </li>
            <li>The diamond models highlighted that phishing was a main point of concern and that hospitals are
              extremely lucrative due to their inability to cease operations. This suggests that the use of AI
              techniques need to be more widespread on the hospital networks so the hospital can proactively safe guard
              its assets.
            </li>
            <li>Hospitals must maintain an open communication structure but AI can help maintain the openness while
              simultaneously providing strong cybersecurity support.
            </li>
